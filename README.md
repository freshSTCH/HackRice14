# A Hack In Time : HackRice 2014

A Hack In Time is a  standard top-down 2D shooter, where you enter a room, shoot up the enemies, and move on. But at the end of each room, time is reversed and you have to make your way back to the start, catching all the bullets you shot back in your gun while dodging everything all over again.
